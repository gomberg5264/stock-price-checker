# Schroders Stock Price Checker by Mason Ifejika

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
See a working version in your browser here: [http://www.masonifejika.com/stock-price-checker/index.html](http://www.masonifejika.com/stock-price-checker/index.html)\
Please see the "Wireframe.png" image in the root of the project directory to see the layout that inspired the web app.\

As this was a time-sensitive exercise, there are several tasks I would have carried out if I had more time, such as:\
* Writing unit tests
* Developing a responsive mobile version of the app
* Creating error handlers for the API timing out or failing to return data
* Learned D3.js (!!)

PLEASE NOTE: before attempting to run the project locally, please run "npm install" in your terminal first, whilst in the project directory.

## Available Scripts

Within your terminal (in the project directory), you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
